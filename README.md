The Bankist App is a simulated banking transaction application developed to showcase various JavaScript functionalities and techniques.  
It allows users to log in, view their account balance, check their transaction history, transfer money to other accounts, request a loan, and close their account.

### Key concepts

These are some of the key JavaScript concepts demonstrated in the Bankist app, showcasing my ongoing journey of understanding and implementing Javascript utilities.
- **DOM Manipulation:**  
  Interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the content and styling of HTML elements based on user actions or application logic.
  For example, updating our account balances, transaction history, and user interface elements like buttons and forms.
- **Event Handling:**  
  Listening for user interactions such as clicks, form submissions, and keypresses. JavaScript event listeners are attached to HTML elements to trigger specific actions or functions when these events occur.
  For instance, logging in, transferring money, requesting a loan, and sorting transaction history.
- **Array Methods:**  
  We've used array methods like forEach, filter, map, and reduce extensively to manipulate and iterate over arrays of account data.
  These methods allow for calculating account balances, summarizing transaction data, and filtering transactions based on specific criteria.
- **Date Manipulation:**  
  The [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) object is utilized to handle dates and times, particularly in formatting and displaying transaction dates.
  The Intl.DateTimeFormat object is used to format dates according to the user's locale, providing a customized experience based on regional preferences.
